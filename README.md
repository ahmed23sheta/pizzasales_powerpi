2- The monthly trend of total demand:
We need to create a line chart that shows an hourly trend of total demand throughout the day.

3- Percentage of sales for each sales category:
We need to create a pie chart that shows popular categories and their contribution to sales.

4- Total pizza sold per category:
We need to create a funnel chart that will help me compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.

5- Top 5 sellers by revenue, total quantity and total orders:
We need to create a bar chart that will help me get the most popular pizza option.

6- The 5 lowest sellers in terms of revenue, total quantity and total orders:
